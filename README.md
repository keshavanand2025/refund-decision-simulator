Refund Decision Simulator
Overview

This project compares rule-based and machine learning approaches for refund decision systems in online platforms.

Refund decisions must balance:

Fraud risk

Customer retention

Operational cost

Methodology

Synthetic dataset (1000 simulated orders)

Rule-based heuristic model

Logistic Regression classifier

Train-test split evaluation

Economic cost simulation

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Total economic cost comparison

Key Objective

To evaluate whether ML-based decision systems reduce overall economic cost compared to traditional rule-based heuristics.
